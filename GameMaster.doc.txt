<- GameMaster ------------------------------------------------------------------
The GameMaster class stores a session of an Awesome Battleships Battles game.

An instance is constructed with:
	new GameMaster();

The class provides the following methods. All of the following methods return
TRUE on success and an array storing the error message under a key "error" on
failure.

mixed	activateShip( $name );
On a player's turn, activate one of their ships by name. That ship can then be
given orders.

mixed	order( $orders );
Tell the currently active ship how to distribute its PP. $orders is an array
containing one or more of the keys "speed", "shields", "weapons", and "repairs",
the value of which is the amount of PP to be assigned to that function.

mixed	move( $orders );
Tell the currently active ship how to move. The array $orders stores a key
"type" which may contain values "move", "turn-left", or "turn-right". Only one
move type may be specified at a time, but multiple move commands may be sent
during the movement phase. If the movement type is "move", then the array must
also contain a key "dist" specifying how many game tiles to move.

mixed	attack();
Tell the currently active ship to attack.

mixed	finishPhase();
Tell the currently active ship to discard any remaining PP, CP, etc. and advance
to the next phase. The phases follow a fixed order: order phase, movement phase,
attacking phase. Calling finishPhase() on the attacking phase will de-activate
the ship. If calling finishPhase() deactivates the last of a player's ships,
then the game will switch to the opponent's turn.
