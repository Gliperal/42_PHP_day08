<- Collidable ------------------------------------------------------------------
The Collidable class represents an object in 2D space with a width and height,
and provides several methods for checking interactions between multiple
Collidables.

The Collidable class is abstract and cannot be instantiated. Any classes which
extend Collidable must provide the following methods:

array	getLocation();
Return the location of the object as ["x" => $x_location, "y" => $y_location].

array	getSize();
Return the size of the object as ["x" => $x_location, "y" => $y_location].

The class provides the following methods:

boolean	overlaps( Collidable $that );
Returns TRUE if this Collidable overlaps $that, FALSE otherwise.

boolean	isOOB();
Returns TRUE if this Collidable has any of its cells outside the range defined
by x in [0, 150) and y in [0, 100).

boolean	hasLineOfSightTo( Collidable $that, Collidable[] $obstacles );
Draws an imaginary line between the center of this Collidable and $that. Returns
TRUE if that line passes through the body of any Collidable in $obstacles, FALSE
otherwise.

float	distanceTo( Collidable $that );
Returns the distance between the top left corners of the two Collidables.
