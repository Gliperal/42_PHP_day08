<- Weapon ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Weapon interface desribes a weapon that can be mounted on a ship, moved
about, and fired.

Any class that inherits weapon must implement the following methods:

void	move($location, $angle);
Move the weapon to a location, facing at an angle. Ideally weapons should be
implemented in such a way (e.g. by storing an offset) that one Ship can send its
location and angle to this function, and the weapon will then place itself
correctly.

void	shoot($ships, $obstacles);
Shoot the weapon, taking into account the locations of ships and obstacles, and
doing damage as necessary.

void	resetCP();
Reset the weapon's Change Points to their default value.

void	receiveCP($amount);
Receive some amount of CP with which to fire the weapon.
