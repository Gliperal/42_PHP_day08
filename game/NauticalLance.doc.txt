<- NauticalLance ---------------------------------------------------------------
The NauticalLance class is a basic weapon that fires in a straight line.

An instance is constructed with an location and angle that represet the location
and angle relative to the ship on which it is mounted. NauticalLances must be
mounted on one of the outermost cells of a ship, facing outwards, or else their
projectiles may hit the ship itself. The following represents one mounted on the
port-side bow (the ship is, at angle 0, facing towards positive "x").

new NauticalLance( array( "x" => 1, "y" => -2 ), 90 ) );

As an subclass of Collidable, it implements all the Collidable methods.
As it implements Weapon, it implements all the Weapon methods.
